How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

I think what went well was that i was very independent during my work and found some very good solutions to problem that I came across and made a lot of progress during the course of the lesson and I think that if I continue this kind of perseverance then this will benefit me a lot in the future. 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I don't think that there is very much that I need to work on as I was very good during the course of the lesson and made a lot of progress with the work that I was doing and Iâ€™m not sure how I could at all fix this.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next time I will just have to try and continue with the work I was doing and try and keep up everything I was doing as this kind of behavior during lessons would allow me to work as well as possible.
