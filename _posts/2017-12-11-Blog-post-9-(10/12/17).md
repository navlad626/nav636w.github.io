How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

This lesson what I improved on was working a lot more independently and I did not ask others around me for help, but worked on finding a solution by myself and I think this shows a lot of perseverance and I fell this is a real improvement on what occurred during the previous lesson. 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

After reaching my target from the previous lesson I do not feel that I really need to work on anything as I had a very good lesson this week and have achieved most of the targets I have set myself in previous lessons.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I will just have to continue all of the good things that I was doing during the course of this lesson and continue all of the good work I had done in this lessons and some of the previous lessons.
