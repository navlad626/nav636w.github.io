How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

This week I feel I showed very good resilience as when I was working at one point I did actually get stuck however, I showed very good perseverance. I continued to work hard on the problem and eventually, without the support of other around me or teachers I was able to complete my work successfully and I think that I must continue this and develop this skill.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

What limited my learning was that when the teacher was explaining something to the class I was talking which the teacher got angry at me for. I should have listened as I could have missed something very important and could've got stuck during my work.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I should not talk when the teacher is discussing something and should listen intently instead of being distracted talking to others around me.
