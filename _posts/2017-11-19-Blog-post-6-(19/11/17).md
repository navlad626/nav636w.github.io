How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

What went well was that in the lesson I worked very quickly and the pace of my work improved a lot. This allowed to complete a lot of work during the lesson and make a lot more progress on my work than I have in previous lessons on spreadsheeting and I think if I keep it up it will be very effective.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I think in the next lessons I need to try and listen to the teacher because a few times I got stuck and was not sure what to do and this slowed down my work even though I worked pretty quickly. This may have been because I did not listen to the teacher.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next lesson I will try to listen more to the teacher so I do not get stuck during the lesson and also continue with my fast paced work. This way I can improve my learning.
