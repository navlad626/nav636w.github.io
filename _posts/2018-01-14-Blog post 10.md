 +How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 
 +
 +This lesson what I did well was that I listened to the teacher very well and was able to remember everything that he told us so when I went to the work I knew exactly what to do. When I compare this to previous weeks I can see a clear improvement as previously I may have got stuck during my work due to the fact I have not listened to the information the teacher provided us with so I am glad that I have been able to change this.
 +
 +What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?
 +
 +However what I feel I could try to improve on would be the pace of my work. I feel as if to many times there are factors that disrupt my work, the main one being that sometimes I talk to my peers to0 much about things that are not work related. This is something I must remove from my work.
 +
 +What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?
 +
 +I feel I can do a lot better if I try to avoid getting at all distracted when I am trying to complete my work. I feel I will be able to work a lot faster so I do really need to extract this from my lessons to improve.
