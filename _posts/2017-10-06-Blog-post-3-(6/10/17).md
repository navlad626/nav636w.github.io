How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

I think that what I did well this week was that I made sure I was always listening to the teacher and a managed to refrain from speaking to other students. This helped me as I was able o work at a faster rate and I think that if I continue this I will always be able to complete all my work quickly and will not have to ask the teacher or others for help as will have been listening to the teacher. 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I think I have improved on all my targets and looking back on this week, I do not feel that there is anything in particular that I need to work on. I think  if I just build on everything I did well this week then this will be most beneficial for me.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next week I will continue with the same behavior I showed this week and continue to listen to the teacher and avoid distractions.
