How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

During this lesson I think I was able to refrain from conversing with my peers and was able to independently. This also allowed me to get more work done and make more progress during the lesson. I should continue to do this as it not only helps me, but when I am talking to the others around me I am distracting them too so I should now try to be focused and continue to be a lot more independent.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Next time I should try to continue improving with the pace of my work as this week it was not as good as it has been previously and if I do not continue to develop this skill I will achieve a lot less during lessons. 

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next lesson I will improve the pace of my work in order to get more and more work done during each lesson ensuring I will not fall behind with my work.
