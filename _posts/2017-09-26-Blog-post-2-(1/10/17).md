How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

I think I improved my work this week as I was more independent and that was something that helped my learning. This meant that instead of just copying my friends and not learning as much I worked on my own and was able to learn more I think that this is an improvement from last lesson as what I wanted to change was how independent I was and I think I improved that this lesson. 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

In some areas however, I did get stuck as I was not listening when the teacher was talking  and did not understand how to do everything and I got stuck in some areas. If I listened to what the teacher said then I think that I wouldn't have got stuck. This would have saved me a lot time.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next time I will listen and watch what the teacher does so I know what to do and I can complete the work as quickly as possible.
