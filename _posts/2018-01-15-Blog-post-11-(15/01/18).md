How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

I think that the pace of my work really improved over this lesson and it has been improving fr many weeks now. I think this is a really important skill that I should continue to develop as by improving the speed at which I work at this will enable me to get more work done and will ultimately prevent me from falling behind and having to catch up.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I think to improve I should next time, try to contribute to class discussions as for many weeks I have not said enough when we are discussing what we are going to do during the lesson. This is something I should change as not only will it improve my confidence, but i do have the right answer but will not say anything as I am unsure if it is correct or not.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I feel I will be able to do a lot better if I were to to talk more in front of the rest of the class and try to voice more of my ideas and opinions during future lessons.
