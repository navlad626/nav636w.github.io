How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

I think that this lesson I really worked hard on improving what I did not do so well last lesson. I worked as quickly as possible trying to avoid distractions. I definitely improved in this area and got distracted a lot less and I think I should continue this as if I were to get distracted this would not only slow me down but I would not be listening to the teacher and not be able to follow various instructions.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Next time I should try to continue improving with the pace of my work as this week it was not as good as it has been previously and if I do not continue to develop this skill I will achieve a lot less during lessons. 

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

Next lesson I will improve the pace of my work in order to get more and more work done during each lesson ensuring I will not fall behind with my work.
