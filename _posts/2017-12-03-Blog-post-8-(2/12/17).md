How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

During some of my previous lessons I think I have not listened to teacher very well and that has meant that I was not able to complete my work as I was not sure what to do as I didn't listen to the teacher, however this lesson, my listening has improved. I was able to remember every I was told by the teacher and complete my work a lot more quickly.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

Even though I listened a lot more to the teacher I did still sometimes get stuck which I feel is inevitable, but when I did get stuck I asked some of the people around me for help without trying to complete my work myself and perseverance and also got distracted by the people around me.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I will try to work much more independently and try to fix the problems I encounter myself without asking for help from my friends.
