How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

During today's lesson what went well was that I achieved my target from last lesson of listening to the teacher a lot more to try and not get stuck during my work and it definitely worked as I did not get stuck at all and remembered how to do everything that the teacher told me to do so completing this target was definitely very effective

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I don't think that there is actually anything that I can improve as I achieved my targets from last week and I did pretty much everything perfectly so I donâ€™t think that there is much too improve on based upon this weeks lesson

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I think that what I need to do is keep up all the good work from this lesson and keep doing everything that I did well in the future and will definitely do very well during my IT lessons I think.
