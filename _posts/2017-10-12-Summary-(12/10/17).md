How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

So far, during all of our lessons I feel that I have done quite well due to the fact that I did achieve all of my targets from the lessons and have been working hard on improving my learning habitats to get more work done and for my work to be at a better standard and I think that my work improved over the lessons.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I feel that the main thing that limited my learning over all of the lessons was that was quite easily distracted by my friends and this did not help me to focus during my work as I was talking to them a bit at the beginning lessons and wasn't 100% focused on my work.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learnings?

I will need to make sure I am not distracted by my friends and I should try to ignore them if they begin to talk to me.
